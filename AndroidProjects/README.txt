These are my Android projects developed during a course in college.

1) Colors - Its a basic application which changes background color based on the option selected via a list view.
2) Crawler - The application uses a thread to download all the links and hyperlinks of a given page and show it to the public.
	     This uses the messenger API's.
3) HTMLImagesAndHyperLinksActivity - Does the same as above. Uses two handlers communication between activities.
4) Wonders - Uses android fragments to showcase images in list view. The image is opened in a separate fragment when an element is clicked.
5) AIDLParcelableExample - Showcases AIDL communication between two activities.
